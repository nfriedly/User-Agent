# User-Agent breakdown

Not quite as cool as the original [WhatsMyUA.com](https://github.com/nfriedly/WhatsMyUA.com/), which went into details about each specific part of the User Agent string, including calling out misinformation.

This version merely provides the string and some specific details, such as browser and OS. But it has the benefit of being statically hostable.
